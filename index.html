<i>My family we have a Corgi's</i>
<p>Among the most agreeable of all small housedogs, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a strong, athletic, and lively little herder who is affectionate and companionable without being needy. They are one of the world's most popular herding breeds</p>
<b>I am very happy</b>
